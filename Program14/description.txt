Brief description of Quest

  The quest takes place in a Burger King. The user begins in the front of the
line and is supposed to order what they want off of the menu. If they order
wrong then they may not get any food, however, if they order correctly and
make the right moves then they will have food. The player may end up having to
wait through the line again, or they may end up kicked out of the
establishment. If they get kicked out then they loose. Going back to the line
does not signal an end to the quest.
