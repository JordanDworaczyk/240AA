; Compute the weight of water in a pipe with the following formula:
; w = PI * (D/24) * L * K
; where
;     w = water weight (pounds)
;     D = pipe diameter (inches)
;     L = pipe length (feet)
;     K = water density (pounds per cubic foot; either 62.4 for pure water,
;         or 64.08 for sea water)
;     PI = pi (3.14159)
; Inputs: pipe diameter, pipe length, and a boolean flag for pure water/not
;         pure water(sea water).

; Compute the total weekly paycheck of an employee at Knaechelkopf's department
; store.
;   (a) Employees are either hourly or paid by commission
;   (b) Hourly employees get their hourly rate times the number of hours,
;   plus time and a half for overtime (more than 40 hours)
;   (c) Commissioned employees get a percentage of their sales, as follows:
;   sales                   rate
;   s < $1000               1%
;   $1000 <= s < $10,000    2.5%
;   s >= $10,000            6%
;   (d) Every employee has the option to contribute to the boss's birthday fund,
;   and the amount of the donation is subtracted from the weekly pay.
; [Inputs: a boolean that indicates employee type (hourly/not hourly), a number
; that indicates either hours or sales, a number that indicates the hourly rate
; (or zero for commissioned employees), and the amount donated to the boss'
; birthday gift fund (zero if no gift). ]
