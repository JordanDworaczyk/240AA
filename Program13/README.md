# Program \#12  
Create an expert system of your own.

---

### Assignment
Choose a topic of interest with a decision-making process that can be modeled
as a decision tree with simple yes-or-no answers to questions. Use the example
presented in class as a starting point and provided new sets of predicates for
the questions, the results, and the logic to determine the appropriate result.

To start the assignment, write a brief description of your topic, and then draw
a decision tree summarizing your logic. Use this to help you design your program
I will not grade your program without this description.

Use the following specifications as a guideline:
* The decision tree should have at least eight leaves (explanations or results), and at least seven internal
nodes (questions).
* I will be flexible with these requirements as long as your
plan is reasonable.
