; Write Scheme expressions to extract each of the items - a,b,c,...,h,i - in
; the following list:
;       ( ( a b ) c ( d ( e f ) ) ( ( g ( h ) i ) ) )
; Use only the "car" and "cdr" functions (and no short-cuts). You may use
; "define" to assign the list to a variable so that you do not have to re-type
; it for each expressions.

; For example, if you were given the list "( x y )", and I asked for an
; expression to extract all the elements, one at a time, then you could use...
;     ( define List '(a b) )
;     ( car List )
;     ( car (cdr List) )

; Do the same for the list given above.

(define List '( ( a b ) c ( d ( e f ) ) ( ( g ( h ) i ) ) ) )
(car List)
(car (cdr List))
